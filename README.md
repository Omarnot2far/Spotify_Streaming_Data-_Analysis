## 🗃️ Data Schema

The data is stored in a PostgreSQL table with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE spotify_streaming_data (
    spotify_track_uri TEXT NOT NULL,
    ts TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    platform TEXT NOT NULL,
    ms_played INTEGER NOT NULL,
    track_name TEXT,
    artist_name TEXT,
    album_name TEXT,
    reason_start TEXT,
    reason_end TEXT,
    shuffle BOOLEAN,
    skipped BOOLEAN
);
```




## 1. User Engagement and Retention
### How much time do users spend listening to music on each platform?


```sql
SELECT 
    platform, 
    SUM(ms_played) / 60000 AS total_minutes_played
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY platform
ORDER BY total_minutes_played DESC;
```

## 2. Track Performance
### What are the top 10 most-played tracks?

```sql
SELECT 
    track_name, 
    artist_name, 
    SUM(ms_played)/60000 AS total_minutes_played
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY track_name, artist_name
ORDER BY total_minutes_played DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
## 3. Skipping Behavior
### What percentage of songs are skipped on shuffle vs. non-shuffle mode?

```sql
SELECT 
    shuffle,
    COUNT(*) AS total_tracks,
    SUM(CASE WHEN skipped = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS skipped_tracks,
	ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN skipped = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::DECIMAL * 100 / COUNT(*), 2) AS skip_percentage
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY shuffle;
```
## 4. Artist and Album Popularity
### Which artist has the highest total playtime?

```sql
Select 
    artist_name,
    SUM(ms_played)/60000 AS total_minutes_played
from spotify_streaming_data
group by artist_name
ORDER BY total_minutes_played DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
## 5. Reasons for Playback
### What are the common reasons users start and stop tracks?
```sql
SELECT
	reason_start,
	COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY reason_start
ORDER BY occurrences DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
SELECT
	reason_end,
	COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY reason_end
ORDER BY occurrences DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
## 6. Track Completion Rate
### How many tracks are played fully without skipping?
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_tracks,
    SUM(CASE WHEN skipped = FALSE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS not_skipped_tracks,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN skipped = FALSE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::DECIMAL * 100 / COUNT(*), 2) AS completion_rate
FROM spotify_streaming_data;
```
## 7. Time-Based Trends
### What is the hourly trend for music streaming activity?
```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ts) AS hour_of_day, 
    SUM(ms_played)/60000 AS total_minutes_played
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ts)
ORDER BY hour_of_day;
```
## 8. Impact of Shuffle Mode
### Does shuffle mode increase or decrease total listening time?
```sql
SELECT 
    shuffle, 
    SUM(ms_played)/60000 AS total_minutes_played
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY shuffle;
```
## 9. Track Starting Patterns
### Which reasons drive the most track starts?
```sql
SELECT 
    reason_start, 
    COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY reason_start
ORDER BY occurrences DESC;
```
## 10. Skipped Tracks Analysis
### Which tracks have the highest skip rate?
```sql
SELECT
    track_name,
    artist_name, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_plays, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN skipped = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS skipped_count,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN skipped = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::DECIMAL * 100 / COUNT(*), 2) AS skip_rate
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY track_name, artist_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10  -- Only consider tracks with more than 10 plays
ORDER BY skip_rate DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
## 11. Album Analysis
### Which albums have the highest average playtime per track?
```sql
SELECT 
    album_name, 
    AVG(ms_played)/60000 AS avg_play_time_minutes
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY album_name
ORDER BY avg_play_time_minutes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
## 12. Platform Preferences
### Which platform is preferred for specific genres or artists?
```sql
SELECT 
    platform, 
    artist_name, 
    SUM(ms_played)/60000 AS total_minutes_played
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY platform, artist_name
ORDER BY total_minutes_played DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
