## üìÇ Dataset

dataset: https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-music-challenge/e161353d-9967-4297-869c-505de168e610

The dataset contains detailed Spotify streaming logs with the following columns:

| **Field**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spotify_track_uri`   | Spotify URI uniquely identifying each track.                                   |
| `ts`                 | Timestamp indicating when the track stopped playing (in UTC).                  |
| `platform`           | Platform used for streaming (e.g., web, mobile, desktop).                      |
| `ms_played`          | Number of milliseconds the track was played.                                   |
| `track_name`         | Name of the track.                                                             |

| `reason_start`       | Why the track started (e.g., playlist, user search).                           |
| `reason_end`         | Why the track ended (e.g., skipped, completed).                                |

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Schema

The data is stored in a PostgreSQL table with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE spotify_streaming_data (
    spotify_track_uri TEXT NOT NULL,
    ts TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    platform TEXT NOT NULL,
    ms_played INTEGER NOT NULL,
    track_name TEXT,
    artist_name TEXT,
    album_name TEXT,
    reason_start TEXT,
    reason_end TEXT,
    shuffle BOOLEAN,
    skipped BOOLEAN
);
```




## 1. User Engagement and Retention
### How much time do users spend listening to music on each platform?


```sql
SELECT 
    platform, 
    SUM(ms_played) / 60000 AS total_minutes_played
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY platform
ORDER BY total_minutes_played DESC;
```

## 2. Track Performance
### Problem: What are the top 10 most-played tracks?

```sql
SELECT 
    track_name, 
    artist_name, 
    SUM(ms_played)/60000 AS total_minutes_played
FROM spotify_streaming_data
GROUP BY track_name, artist_name
ORDER BY total_minutes_played DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
